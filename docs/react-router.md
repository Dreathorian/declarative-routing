## Installation and Usage on NextJS

Initialize your NextJS application:

```bash
npx declarative-routing init
```

This will generate an `./src/routes` directory (you can specify the location during the install) that you can use to navigate to routes. It also generates a `DR-README.md` file in the root of your project that contains information about how to use the system.
